# Face-Recognition-Attendance-LLM
Automated face-recognition attendance system built with MATLAB and OpenAI APIs. Captures real-time student images, logs attendance in Excel, and prevents proxy entries.
This repository contains the implementation of a Face Recognition-Based Attendance System developed as part of the Digital Image Processing (AIML633P) mini-project. The system uses MATLABâ€™s Image Processing and Computer Vision toolboxes to capture student images during registration, store them in a structured dataset, and recognize faces in real time to automate attendance marking. Attendance logs are securely stored in Excel sheets, ensuring accuracy and preventing duplicate entries.

**Key features include:**

Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier (vision.CascadeObjectDetector)

Student registration with automatic dataset creation

Attendance logging with duplicate prevention and timestamp recording

Scalable for educational institutions and corporate environments

The project demonstrates integration of AI/ML principles with computer vision techniques, making it adaptable for future enhancements such as deep learning-based recognition, IoT integration, or cloud deployment.
